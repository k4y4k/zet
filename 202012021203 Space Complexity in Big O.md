title: Space Complexity in Big O

Algorithms often need to make a tradeoff between time and space / memory
requirements. A slow, space-efficient algorithm might be better in one scenario,
but a quick, memory-intensive one might suit another better.

It's always a balancing act.

When analysing space complexity, Big O considers the _additional_ space required
by an algorithm, not including the initial size of [[202012021155 n]].
