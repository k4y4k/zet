Big O expresses an algorithm's runtime in terms of how quickly the runtime or [[202012021203 Space Complexity in Big O|space complexity]] grows as the input to an algorithmgets bigger and bigger up to an indefinite, arbitrary point. The input of an algorithm is called [[202012021155 n]].

Those expressions look like this:

| Expression | Name           | What It Means                                            |
| ---------- | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `O(1)`     | constant time  | runtime stays the same relative to the size of the input |
| `O(n)`     | linear time    | runtime increases linearly relative to input size        |
| `O(n^2)`   | quadratic time | runtime grows exponentially compared to input            |

An algorithm can be described by several expressions, depending on [[202012021213 Case]].
