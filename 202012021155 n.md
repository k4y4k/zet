`n` is the name commonly given to the input to an algorithm. It can be _actual_
input OR _size_ of input.

# Why `n`?

As [[202012011552 Big O]] measures the propensity for an algorithm's
requirements growth, not the requirements themselves, real units (both for time
and space) are out of the question.

Instead, the requirements of an algorithm are
[[202012021151 Big O Expressions|expressed]] relative to the size of the input
(`n`).
