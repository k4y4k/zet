There are three elements to 'good' (as opposed to mediocre or outright 'bad') code. These are:

- **readability**; and
- scalability; which encompasses
  - **Memory** / space complexity
  - **Speed** / time complexity

Readability is 'how readable' the code is - how easy it is for your future self / others to read.

Scalability is measured by way of [[202012011552 Big O]]. 'Good' code scales well to all sorts of workloads.
