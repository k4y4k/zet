There are two elements to 'good' (as opposed to mediocre or outright 'bad') code. These are:

- _readability_; and
- _scalability_

Readability is 'how readable' the code is - how easy it is for your future self / others to read.

Scalability is measured by way of [[202012011552 Big O]]. 'Good' code scales well to all sorts of workloads.
