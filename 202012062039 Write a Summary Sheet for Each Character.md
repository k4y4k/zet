This is the third step in the [[202012061953 How to Write with the Snowflake Method|Snowflake Method]]. Perform this step for every important character (so, all of them ðŸ™ƒ).

Cover these points:

- Role (Hero, heroine, villain, mentor, sidekick, friend, whatever)
- Name
- Concrete goal
- Abstract ambition
- values (several sentences that start with 'nothing is more important than...')
- conflict: what keeps this character from achieving their goal
- epiphany (if relevant): what will this character learn by the end of the story
- one-sentence summary of _this character's personal story_ [^1]
- one-paragraph summary: the previous point, but expanded

> Some characters are too minor to need a one-sentence summary or a one-paragraph summary. Don't feel obligated to fill in everything for all characters. [#ingermanson-HowWriteNovel2014]

[^1]: The novel is the lead/s personal story. Every character has their own personal story.
