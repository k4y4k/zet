| Operation                           | Time Complexity |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------- |
| lookup (key -> value, average case) | `O(1)`          |
| lookup (value -> key)               | `O(n)`          |
| lookup (collision)                  | `O(n)`          |

Hash tables are another way of building on an [[202012021931 Arrays|Array]]: a regular array is like a 2Ã—`n` table, like so:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| 0        | "this"   |
| 1        | "is"     |
| 2        | "what's" |
| 3        | "inside" |

We don't get to pick what the first column (the indices / keys of each element) is: that's managed by the array.

But with hash tables, we _can_ pick what's in the first column - we can pick the keys under which to store our values!

This is done via use of a [[202012030919 Hashing Function]] which is a way to transform an arbitrary key (e.g. a string) into an array-friendly index.

A simple hashing algorithm for strings might look like this:

1. Create a key under which to store a value
2. Convert each character in the key into a numerical character code
3. Sum the character codes to get a total
4. Total % array length = hash

For example, to hash the key `kayak`, using UTF-8, into an array of length 30:

```
k = u+006b = 107
a = u+0061 = 97
y = u+0079 = 121

107 + 97 + 121 + 97 + 107 = 529

529 % 30 = 19
```

Therefore, we can put whatever value we want assigned to key `kayak` into index `19` of our hash table.

If two keys hash to the same value, that's called a [[202012030911 Hash Collision]].

Hash table lookups differ, depending on the direction. Keys looking for values is `O(1)`. Values looking for keys have to iterate through the whole map, so they're `O(n)`.
