title: Write a Long Four-Page Synopsis
date: 2020-12-06 21:11

This is step six in the [[202012061953 How to Write with the Snowflake Method|Snowflake Method]].

Take a few hours to expand the one-page synopsis into 4-5 pages.

This is for finding the biggest / earliest plot holes and to flesh out some details in the story.

Trim this down if you ever need to include a synopsis with the proposal.
