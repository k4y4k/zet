> Any programmer, given enough time, can solve a problem. What matters, though, is how well the problem is solved. [#neagoie-23SectionOverview2020]

Big O Asymptotic Analysis (or just Big O for short) is how we measure an algorithm, either by considering its time or [[202012021203 Space Complexity in Big O|space]] requirements (often called 'complexity' by high-power brains).

It makes for an even playing field. In [[202012021151 Big O Expressions]], the finer details are less important than the general gist of what's going on.

Big O is helpful but is only a tool for analysis. It identifies possible [[202012021213 Case|best / average / worst case]] scenarios, but it's only one lens through which to view a solution in.

It's best not to get too caught up on what the Big O of an algorithm is. Optimise later!
