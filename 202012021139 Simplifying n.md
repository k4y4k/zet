In [[202012011552 Big O]], we simplify [[202012021155 n]].

For example:

- `O(2n)` is more correctly expressed as `O(n)`
- `O(1 + n/2 + 100)` is simplified to `O(n)` - this is because, as `n` gets bigger, `+ 100` or `n / 2` don't matter as much anymore.

One thing to keep in mind is to only worry about the _most significant term_:

- `O(n + n^2)` gets simplified to `O(n^2)`
- `O(n^3 + 50n^2 + 10,000)` becomes `O(n^3)`

This is because these less significant factors have less and less of an impact as `n` grows. Big O is most concerned with the 'steps' of an algorithm that get and stay expensive as `n` grows.
