This is the first step in the [[202012061953 How to Write with the Snowflake Method|Snowflake Method]].

Write a single sentence that summarises the story, but don't give away the ending, and try not to go over 25 words. This sentence will eventually become the elevator pitch. If people are in the target audience, their reaction will be something like:

> 🧐 yes please tell me more 👀

and if they're not:

> 🙄🤚 I hate good literature smh
