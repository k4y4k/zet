Arrays are ubiquitous. They seem to be everywhere and / or anything. [[202012021828 RAM]] is basically an array. Am _I_ an array?!

They're rigid structures that work because they're contiguous - each element in the array is a uniformly-sized block, making the whole array a solid chunk of memory.

This rigidity comes with drawbacks, though: every item in an array needs to be exactly the same size, otherwise the whole concept breaks.

However, the fact that array elements need to be uniform means that the logic for finding the `n`th item is pretty clear to understand:

```
address of nth element = address of 0th element +
  (n / size of each element in bytes)
```
