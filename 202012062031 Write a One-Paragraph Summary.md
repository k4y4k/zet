This is the second step in the [[202012061953 How to Write with the Snowflake Method|Snowflake Method]]. In this step, you expand your one-sentence summary of the story into a whole paragraph, roughly following this structure:

1. Explain the setting. Set the scene. _Maybe_ introduce one or two main characters.
2. Summarise Act 1 up to the first disaster - this event is what makes the lead/s commit to the scenario.
3. Then summarise the first half of Act 2 up to the second disaster - this second major event changes the way the lead/s think and act for the rest of the story.
4. Summarise the second half of act 2, up to the third disaster. This event causes the lead/s and the antagonist to commit to ending the story.
5. Summarise Act 3, where everything comes together and the story ends.

The paragraph ensures that the structure is sound: solid 3 acts and a good moral premise.
