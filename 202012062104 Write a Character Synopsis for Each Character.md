This is step five of [[202012061953 How to Write with the Snowflake Method|the Snowflake Method]].

Perform this step for each character.

Take an hour or so and write up the character's backstory as well as their role in the main story (about 250-500 words is fine).

Explain why they are the way they are, what they want, and everything else worth mentioning. Explain how they fit into the story. Go ham.

This is for your benefit, to help you find the character, so try to go into as much detail as possible.
