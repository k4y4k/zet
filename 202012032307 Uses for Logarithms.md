These are some ways to use [[202012031004 Logarithms]].

Simplification: `log b (bˣ)` = `x` [^1]

Multiplication: `log b (x * y)` = `log b (x) + log b (y)`

Division: `log b (x / y)` = `log b (x) - log b (y)`

Powers: `log b (xʸ)` = `y * log b (x)`

Change of base: `log b (x)` = `(log c (x)) / (log c (b))` [^2]

[^1]: It's useful for bringing a variable down from an exponent
[^2]: Useful for changing the base of a logarithm from `b` to `c`
