| Operation | Time Complexity |
| --------- | --------------- |
| appends   | `O(1)`          |
| prepend   | `O(1)`          |
| lookup    | `O(n)`          |

Linked lists are made of nodes. Nodes are made up of two pieces: the data 'in' the node, and a [[202012021943 Pointers (in Arrays)|pointer]] to the `next` node. These nodes can be placed anywhere in memory, without worrying about order, as that's taken care of via pointers. The fact that they're relatively tiny helps with the 'can be anywhere' factor, too.

The first node of a linked list is called the `head` node. The last one is the `tail` (usually). Some people define `tail` as 'everything that's after `head`'. It's best to be clear about which definition you're using, if you're not sure about the one that your audience is using.

It's also important to keep a reference to `head` somewhere - otherwise we can't find our way back! Another reference to `tail` is handy to have too.

Appending to a linked list looks like: (it's `O(1)` time)

1. Create the new node
2. Tweak the `next` pointer in the old `tail`
3. Update the reference to `tail` to reflect the new node

Lookups with linked lists aren't cache-friendly, as they require walking through each node and subsequently following its `next` pointer, which could be anywhere in memory and is thus not likely to be adjacent or nearby to the last one.
