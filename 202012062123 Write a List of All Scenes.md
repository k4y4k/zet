This is step 8 of the [[202012061953 How to Write with the Snowflake Method|Snowflake Method]].

Take a few days and create a list of every scene in the story.

> The scene is the fundamental unit of fiction. Each scene happens at a particular place and time and includes certain characters. (Ingermanson, 2014)

Each scene needs conflict. No filler!

Make a table or a spreadsheet or something:

| POV character | What happens | Timeline? | Target word count? |
| ------------- | ------------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| - - -         | - - -        | - - -     | - - -              |
