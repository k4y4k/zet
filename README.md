## Vaguely 'Academic' Notes

Citations / references in this document are generated with Zotero and the Better Bibtex plugin. Citekeys are generated with this template: `[authors2+-:lower:nopunct]-[shorttitle3_3][year]`. This results in keys like `test-ImpressiveTitle2020`

The bibliography style used here is APA 6th. A BibLaTeX file (`zet.bib`) is included, because... because.
