Logarithms are just the awkward math person way of asking _'what power do we raise this base to in order to get this answer?'_

They look like this: `log₁₀ (100)`. This is asking _what power do we raise `10` to to get `100`?_

The answer is 2, because `10² = 100`. Therefore, `log₁₀ (100) = 2`

Logarithms are used for solving `x` when `x` is in an exponent and thus does not submit to the regular law enforcement.

Take this equation - `10ˣ = 100` - and solve for `x`:

1. First, take the `log₁₀` of both sides: `log₁₀ (10ˣ)` = `log₁₀ (100)`
2. `x` = `log₁₀ (100)`
3. `x` = 2

The questions "How many times should we double 1 to get `n`" and "How many times must we halve `n` to get 1" come up a lot in computer science, and the answer to both is `log₂ (n)`

In computer science, the log base is usually implied to be 2 (not 10 like it is everywhere else). Therefore, for the purposes of Big O-related math, `log (n)` === `log₂ (n)`. Also noteworthy: Big O disregards the base - it's a constant.

There's a special notation for when the log base is 2: `lg`. Therefore, the correct notation is actually `O(lg (n))`.
