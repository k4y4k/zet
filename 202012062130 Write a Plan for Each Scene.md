This is step 9 of [[202012061953 How to Write with the Snowflake Method|the Snowflake Method]]. Do this for each scene.

Take a few minutes for each scene and write down some notes. Maybe a list of characters? Maybe describe the setting? Maybe some dialogue?

Is it a Proactive Scene or a Reactive Scene?

A Proactive scene looks like this:

1. goal
2. conflict
3. setback

A Reactive scene looks like this:

1. reaction
2. dilemma
3. decision

There isn't a standard length for a scene. A mix works.
