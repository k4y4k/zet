RAM stands for _Random Access Memory_. Each address in RAM can store 8 bits, or 1 byte.

It's connected to the memory controller (which, in turn, is connected to the CPU). This memory controller can access anywhere in RAM non-sequentially (hence the _Random_ part of RAM).

Whenever the CPU wants something from RAM, the controller also returns a few adjacent addresses. These populate the CPU's cache.

This is handy if a program wants nearby (or contiguous) addresses in RAM: the data is already in the CPU's cache, so it's practically instant.
