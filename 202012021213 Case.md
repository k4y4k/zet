An algorithm can potentially be described by several different
[[202012021151 Big O Expressions]].

For example, an algorithm that loops through an array looking for something may
find it first try, or not find it at all.

Therefore, the algorithm has two cases:

- the _best case_, where the element is found on the first try; and
- the _worst case_, where the element is not found.

The best case of this algorithm can be expressed as having a runtime of `O(1)`,
in that the algorithm only runs one time and achieves its goal.

The worst case for this algorithm's runtime is therefore `O(n)`, where the
algorithm runs the same amount of time as its input size (once per array
element).
